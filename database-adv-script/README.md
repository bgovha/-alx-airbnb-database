# Unleashing Advanced Querying Power

## Complex Queries with Joins

- INNER JOIN: Combines rows from two tables based on a related column.
- LEFT JOIN: Returns all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table.
- RIGHT JOIN: Returns all rows from the right table, and the matched rows from the left table.
- FULL OUTER JOIN: Returns all rows when there is a match in either left or right table.

## Subqueries

- Correlated Subqueries: Subqueries that use the results of the outer query.
- Non-Correlated Subqueries: Subqueries that do not depend on the outer query.

## Aggregation and Window Functions

- GROUP BY: Groups rows based on a column or expression.
- HAVING: Filters groups based on a condition.
- SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN: Aggregate functions to calculate totals.
- RANK, DENSE_RANK, ROW_NUMBER: Window functions for ranking rows.
